          I always code in order to learn more about becoming a web developer. My ambition is to become a professional
          web developer, which is why I am constantly honing my skills in html, CSS, and javascript, as well as anything
          else related to web development. Every day, I set aside time to relax my mind before beginning what I should
          do when it comes to coding. I've been studying web development for 6 months and I can now literally make a
          responsive website, web design, and a little programming. I'd like to learn more about what is related to web
          development. I am currently broadening my knowledge of Javascript, jQuery, Reactjs, and other web development
          topics. In my mind I may not be the best asset for your company. But I know I can make myself enough
          employee at work.
